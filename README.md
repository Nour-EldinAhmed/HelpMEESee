## Usage

Once you have the HELP ME SEE application running on your Android device or emulator, it assists visually impaired individuals in detecting objects in their surroundings. The application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting images or accessing the device's camera.

1. Launch the app on your Android device.

2. The app will display a screen with two options: one for text reader and the other for object detection.

3. Choose the desired option:

   a. Text Reader: If you select this option, the app will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to capture and read out text from documents, books, or any printed material in real-time. Simply point your device's camera towards the text, and the app will provide voice output, making it easier for visually impaired individuals to access written information.

   b. Object Detection: If you select this option, the app will utilize TensorFlow Lite's object detection model to identify objects in your surroundings. The camera preview will open, and object detection will start automatically. Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes overlaid on the camera view. The app will provide real-time voice output, describing the objects it detects.

4. Customize the object detection settings using the provided options in the app. You can adjust the sensitivity, enable or disable audio feedback, and explore other configuration options to enhance the user experience.

5. Enjoy real-time voice output and assistance as you use the Sharvan app to read text or detect objects around you.

Feel free to explore the features and functionalities of the app to provide a seamless and enhanced experience for visually impaired users.
